Bugs to fix:

* If ingredients selected has no recipes available, IndexOutOfBounds exception occurs - needs try/catch - Recipes.java:82, Recipes.java:87 (FIXED)
* On landscape, MainActivity buttons not constrained identically - FIXED
* Ingredients are excluded based on dietary requirements, but recipes are not in standard search (Tested: Selected "lacto-veg (excludes meat, fish and eggs but not dairy), and results that needed eggs still appears" (FIXED)
* Ingredient suggestion suggests ingredients that are supposed to be excluded (FIXED)
* Recipe_results - suggestions arent perfectly constrained when clicked - fixed by changing limit to two ingredients, and text size (FIXED)
* Can't add more than 7 ingredients without app crashing, seems to be bug in Recipes.java:85 amd 95 - caused by another Log.d (FIXED)
* When clicking on suggested missing ingredient, activity reloads. Shouldn't happen! - (FIXED) - with an overload method by giving each recipe a unique ID
* Login box text displays "Sign In" even to email addresses that may not exist on DB (FIXED) - added additonal if else and changed email validation from custom
regex to android inbuilt validation
* Ads not always populating from AdMob - not a bug - just flaw due to app being new. Have changed parameters to "wrap_content" for elements to hide when no ad is served
